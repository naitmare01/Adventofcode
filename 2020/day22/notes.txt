- Before either player deals a card, if there was a previous round in this game that had exactly the 
same cards in the same order in the same players' decks, the game instantly ends in a win for player 1. 
Previous rounds from other games are not considered. (This prevents infinite games of Recursive Combat, 
which everyone agrees is a bad idea.)

- Otherwise, this round's cards must be in a new configuration; the players begin the round by each 
drawing the top card of their deck as normal.

- If both players have at least as many cards remaining in their deck as the value of the card they just drew, 
the winner of the round is determined by playing a new game of Recursive Combat (see below).

- Otherwise, at least one player must not have enough cards left in their deck to recurse; 
the winner of the round is the player with the higher-value card.

###
Recursive game:
During a round of Recursive Combat, if both players have at least as many cards in their own decks as 
the number on the card they just dealt, the winner of the round is determined by recursing into a 
sub-game of Recursive Combat. (For example, if player 1 draws the 3 card, and player 2 draws the 7 card, 
this would occur if player 1 has at least 3 cards left and player 2 has at least 7 cards left, not 
counting the 3 and 7 cards that were drawn.)

To play a sub-game of Recursive Combat, each player creates a new deck by making a copy of the next 
cards in their deck (the quantity of cards copied is equal to the number on the card they drew to trigger 
the sub-game). During this sub-game, the game that triggered it is on hold and completely unaffected; no 
cards are removed from players' decks to form the sub-game. (For example, if player 1 drew the 3 card, their
deck in the sub-game would be copies of the next three cards in their deck.)
